			<h1>Hello there!</h1>
				<p>My name is Stanley, and it seems that you have just stumbled upon my site of book reviews for technology books.</p>
				<p>This website was made to make it easier look wade through the mounds of computer and technology-related books and find one worth picking up. Basically, I give you your first impressions and you decide whether or not the book I looked at is worth looking at yourself. Let me help you-- the curious reader seeking advice on a particular direction for a book-- do that! I will review the technology books that I happen to come across and read, spilling my opinions and thoughts into the hypertext. This website will serve as a guide for your decision on which book to buy, borrow, or pass. Sounds like a good deal, right?</p>
				<p>Occasionally, I will also update on my progress of reading of current books, some opinions about current technology news, and maybe even provide some of my own thoughts of other non-technical readings that I do, such as science fiction novels or short stories. Basically, anything that I find of particular interest worth sharing, I will share it.</p>
				<p>Reviews and impressions will be posted up once I finish reading the book... And when I have the time to write a review for you guys to read- so give me a little time to do it. Additionally, this site is still a <em>work in progress</em>!</p>
				<p>Well? What are you waiting for? Start navigation through the hypertext and start looking for what you want to know more about!</p>
