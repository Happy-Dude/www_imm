				<p><em>Review date:</em> 20 Feb 2011</p>
				
				<p>I read this book for one of my required courses for my Information Security major at RIT. Interestingly enough, I bought the book way before I knew that it was a required reading; I just so happened to stumble upon it on my Recommended Books section on Amazon. I decided to order the book due to the fact that it was well praised and I wanted to dive into the world of computer security. Little did I know about who wrote this book, Bruce Schneiner, and his single-hand expertise in the subject&#0133;</p>
				
				<p><a href="http://www.schneier.com/about.html">Bruce Schneiner</a> is probably one of <em>the</em> authorities of computer security and cryptography. He has created his own cryptographic solutions and algorithms, helped testified in the government on certain proceedings concerning security, and hailed as a "security guru." I am impressed by his de facto knowledge on the field, and honored to have even stumbled upon a work of his by chance. But I digress, enough about the author and more about the book.</p>
				
				<p><em>Secrets and Lies</em> is a 448 page exposition on the field of computer security. It does an excellent job making the reader more informed without getting overly distracted with the deeper details. Bruce Schneiner presents the field with an overhead glance, exposing issues of concern, solutions that are backed by common sense, and provides his own expert opinion of the subject at hand.</p>
				
				<p>This book won't make you an expert on the computer security landscape, but it will make you more informed about the situation. The book is well organized in three dissected parts, covering threats, protection mechanisms, and strategies for implementation and protection. Throughout the book, Schneiner stresses how the field of digital security is becoming worse, but gives insight into ways we can help tip the scale to our favor again.</p>
				
				<p>Although I believe this book is a wonderful introductory piece on the topic of digital security, there is one bit that I didn't like, and the reader will find out at the end of the book. I'll try not to spoil much, but this book is a revelation made by him realizing an essential matter in computer security, and how he applied it to his own needs. Other than this, I can find no fault in the book. It does what it sets out to do: inform the reader.</p>
				
				<p>This book is perhaps <em>the</em> introductory piece for those looking to get into the field of computer security. I was pleased to have it as a required reading or else who knows when I would&apos;ve read it. Bruce Schneiner's writing is elegant and concise, and his expertise on the subject just shines through his writing. He is passionate about his field, and hopes to pass that passion into the future cyber-professionals. I myself hope to put this knowledge into good use. For only $18 retail, this 500 page exposition is well worth the money and time.</p>
