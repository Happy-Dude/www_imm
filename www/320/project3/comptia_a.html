				<p><em>Review date:</em> 28 Jan 2011</p>
				
				<p>I picked up this book in order to study for the CompTIA A+ exam. (I passed, in case you were wondering.) This book is updated for the 2009 CompTIA A+ exam objectives, and it served as my main resource for the exam.</p>
				
				<p>This book comes at a price of $60, and with that, you get 1300+ pages worth of content. Reading the book cover to cover, I say it&apos;s well worth the money. However, remember to give yourself enough legroom to fully understand the concepts in preparation for the exam.</p>
				
				<p>Meyers writes in a logical progression, putting his chapters together in such a way that they can be closely related with each other. If you&apos;ve read about input and output, you wouldn&apos;t be too far from the video cards chapter. I found that very well thought out and effective. Additionally, he provides  the reader with practice questions after each chapter to review how well they&apos;ve understood (and applied) what they&apos;ve just read.</p>
				
				<p>Unfortunately, not all things are good about the book. It is 1300+ pages worth of comprehensive review of many different topics. The book comes in heavy, and leaves the reader tired after a long session of cramming. I suggest reading not in large chunks but in manageable bites in addition to glancing at previous chapters for a quick review. It is not the norm for a person to quickly recall everything they&apos;ve read with accuracy, so don't be stress yourself trying to memorize every little detail. Concerning myself, I was only able to recall the general knowledge and associate it with facts/ common sense on the exam. There was no way (given the time I had) I could have memorized every single nook and cranny about printers and their parts&#0133; </p>
				
				<p>While not a particularly <em>kind</em> source of study, it is my go-to reference for anything even vaguely associated with the A+ objectives. I&apos;ve gone back to the book repeatedly to look up information on LCD dot pitch and USB transfer speeds. The diagrams are great for explanations that are better served by a mix of visual representations, and the wit and knowledge of author shines through his words.</p>
				
				<p>There are several slight errors in the book, such as grammar and spelling, but those are easily forgiven as the spirit of the book and the content remains of a consistent quality. The book is well-written and very comprehensive. If you choose to study for the A+ exam, use this book in tandem with any other resource you have, and you can&apos;t go wrong.</p>
