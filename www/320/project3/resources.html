			<h1>Resources used for this website:</h1>
			
			<p>Project 2:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The design of the website was done with the aid of one of my dormmates. The color scheme was provided (or inspired) by using <a href="http://colorschemedesigner.com/">Color Scheme Designer</a> the (with FF8E00 as the primary color). The stylesheet can be viewed <a href="./styles.css">here.</a></li>
				<li> Slashdot has a format of reviewing technical <a href="http://books.slashdot.org/books/08/02/20/1439224.shtml">books</a> that I sought to emulate somehow in my website.</li>
				<li> Of course, looking at Amazon as a reference on how they did their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Art-Exploitation-Jon-Erickson/product-reviews/1593271441/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8">user reviews</a> was unavoidable. I tried to get some inspiration, but I don't believe I would have the resources to implement some of the styling they did. However, what was more important to me was how they organized the information (such as ISBN and publication date) for their products.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Project 3:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>There was a lot of content added, and it felt like I started writing essays instead of doing a webpage&#0133; I hope that didn't get in the way of the actual website</li>
				<li>I felt like a well marked up webpage shouldn't really need comments. The clear semantic divisions <em>should</em> speak for itself (just like how well coded programs are easy to digest and read).</li>
				<li>Book images were gathered from Amazon</li>
				<li>Book image used in logo was from a Google images search</li>
				<li>Many thanks to my friend who helped me figure out how somethings with the layout and for lending me use of his computer to use Photoshop</li>
