				<p><em>Review date:</em> 20 Feb 2011</p>
				
				<p>Neal Stephenson is best known for his novels in science fiction, so where in the world does this author come out with a book about computers, and of all things, the <em>command line</em>?!?</p>
				
				<p>Well, as it turns out, Neal Stephenson, as a writer- and especially one of science fiction- has to be familiar with technology and how to use it. (By realizing this factor, he has already gained immense respect from me.) He is a computer enthusiast himself, and has tried different systems that best helps him in his work and leisure. This got him in touch with his inner techie that is in everyone, and realized some very interesting things about the technology available to him at the time. Thus, he decided to write an essay discussing the past, present, and potential future of operating systems. This <em>essay</em> became a brilliant book, and a book that is well worth a read by any techie.</p>
				
				<p>This book isn&apos;t just about the command line, but it starts there to give a common perspective of how things branched out from there. Stephenson is surprisingly well educated in computing, and has strong (but sensible) opinions about the world entrenched by Microsoft, the underdog that is Apple, and the important but largely ignored Linux. He also describes the now defunct BeOS as one of the potential computing milestones, a landmark if you will, once done right. Interestingly, he points out how BeOS is largely still incomplete, and his predictions of its failures came true in a few years afterwards.</p>
				
				<p>Stephenson also explores the world of computing through the eyes of not just a techie, but that of the average consumer. He points out that while on the surface, the world of computing might be scary and complex, it is actually quite enlightening once you understand how everything comes about. He puts everything in perspective, especially with the process of buying, selling, and choosing in a world manipulated by externalities. What the consumer chooses is the <em>easiest</em> choice for them, but oftentimes is not the best. With the advent of the graphical user interface, people are increasingly removed from the inner workings of their machines. There are many things to be said about how convoluted the computing landscape is today as a buyer&apos;s market, and Stephenson provides some interesting metaphors that makes the reader rethink his position in the world of computing. The landscape may be influenced by corporate factors, but there is by no means a hivemind as long as there are choices that can be made.</p>
				
				<p>I love how the author writes with wit and humor. His metaphors are very amusing, accurate (if I must say so myself), and appeals especially to geeks who already have a sense of what he is talking about. One of my favorite metaphors involved how he compared the popular operating systems to <em>cars</em>: Macs are like a luxurious European car, Windows is a station wagon that keeps chugging along (despite breaking down and requiring maintenance often), Linux is a <em>free</em> tank, and BeOS is a batmobile. Stephenson argues that the reason why people choose Windows and Macs over more wonderful and exciting options is because of the low barrier of use and entry, as well as the ease of maintaining the systems&#0133; Which, in fact, simply lie in handing the misbehaving <em>vehicle</em> to someone else to fix. And there are much more where that came from if you won't mind reading the book yourself.</p>
				
				<p>This book is a must read for techies. It is witty, funny, and very rewarding to get through. However, the reader must take the book with a grain of salt since it is, after all, one person&apos;s opinion about the operating system landscape. Another thing to note is the period of technology in which this book was written in: 1999. It is seriously out of date, and many things that were facts back then no longer apply. Despite the piece not aging well and no longer being accurate on some points, Stephenson's book still provides an excellent exploratory piece on the operating system landscape and provides some perspective on how things came to be today.</p> 
				
				<p>There is a 2004 response to Stephenson's exposition which Garrett Birkel wrote and published <a href="http://garote.bdmonkeys.net/commandline/index.html">online</a>. Birkel's response and comments are just as witty as Stephenson's, and contrasts nicely with the original author. Additionally, it brings the piece more up-to-date (though it certainly isn&apos;t age proof). </p>
				
				<p>Both the <a href="http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html">original book</a> and the <a href="http://garote.bdmonkeys.net/commandline/index.html">2004 response</a> are available online for viewing and reading, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.</p>
