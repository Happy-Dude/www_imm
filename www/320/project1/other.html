		<h2>My bookmarks</h2>
			<p class='tab'><a href="./media/bookmarks.html">Here</a> is a copy of my bookmarks file; it has all the sites that I follow and frequent often. Look at it as if you were looking at a little piece of "me" on the internet.</p>
			
		<h2>My first webpage (for the Brooklyn Public Library)</h2>
			<p class='tab'><a href="./media/WebPageStan20080818/index.htm">Click here</a> to view a webpage that I made for the Brooklyn Public Library. It is a very simplistic page, with a goal of describing the program that I participated in. Though, it is worth noting that it was also a page I worked on with another friend who helped include some javascript elements. I think it is interesting to see and compare since now I am taking a formal class in web design. However, validation is a bit messy because of several non-standard elements. Regardless, I hope they will display acceptably on certain browsers.</p>
