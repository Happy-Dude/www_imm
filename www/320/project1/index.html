		<h2>About Me</h2>	
		
		<p>
			Hi, my name is Stanley Chan. It seems you have stumbled upon my website, and I hope you enjoy your stay. I am a computer geek- currently double majoring in <span class="italic">Information Security and Forensics</span> and <span class="italic">Applied Networking and Systems Administration</span> at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). While computers are my main obsession, I also enjoy reading, playing video games, watching movies and television, and hanging out with my friends. I love discovering new and brilliant indie games as well as losing myself in the next science fiction, fantasy, or mystery novel that lands in my hands.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			This website was made for my <span class="italic">Intro to Multimedia</span> class and is meant to be a professional jump-start page for people looking into who I am. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			It is a hub to attract potential employers. My target employers include the technically-oriented community and technology-based employers. The employers I wish to attract include anyone from information technology to networking and information security. I don't have a clear idea of what my future career might hold, so I am happy to attract any wanderer's attention in the first place. Let's hope I get this right!
