	<h2>Stuyvesant High School: 2006-2010</h2>
		<p class="tab">
			Stuyvesant High School is the top public high school in New York City, and it was a pleasure for me to attend school there. Being one of the best schools of the country, I was offered many advanced and higher-level courses and a vast amount of extracurricular activities. It was at Stuyvesant that I got an established programming background and expanded my knowledge of all sorts of subjects. I participated in the school's FIRST Robotics team and gained teambuilding experiences. Stuyvesant was the place which sprung me into the world, hitting me hard and making me pull myself together as quickly as possible in order to meet the demand of work and play.

	<h2>Rochester Institute of Technology: 2010-Present</h2>
		<p class="tab">
			I am currently attending Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) with a double major in Information Security and Forensics (ISF) and Applied Networking and Systems Administration (ANSA). I chose to attend RIT because it had the (very specific) majors that I wanted to pursue and facilities which I thought would foster my education. As of yet, I am very happy of my decision. Here, I met many like minded individuals all having similar goals and interests. I have made friends that could connect with me and help me in times of need. I finally have the opportunity to let my interests in computing (and its related fields) run wild, expanding what I know and learning new things. I am a member of SPARSA (Security Practices And Research Student Association), the Applied Security Group, and RITLUG (RIT Linux User Group)- extracurriculars which connect me to other people and learn new things. I look forward to the potential opportunities I can seize and the challenges that I hope I can overcome.
