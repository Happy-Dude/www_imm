<h2>About HTML (or rather, Web Design)</h2>

<p><acronym title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</acronym> is the abbreviation of HyperText Markup Language. It is the sort of programming code that a web browser reads and interprets as the web page you see here.</p>

<p>HTML may seem complicated but in reality, it is just a problem of understanding and knowing the code. There are many conventions and "tags" involved in web page design, coming from the ranges of displaying simple text to making flash games. Once you understand and know HTML and web page design, designing web sites, as I've found out, can be quite fun.</p>

<p>Now, HTML is only at the core of a web page. Mostly, HTML is for the basic content. Now, the fancy stuff and looks you see on a modern webpage, uses <acronym title="Cascading Sheet Styles">CSS</acronym>. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a method of taking your webpage and formatting and adding style to the page. Fancying the page is easily done though CSS codes and tags, which, if used with experitise, can easily replace those expensive-thousand-dollar design applications. A web page also has Javascript, whose code is responsible for all those nifty effects found on a webpage. Scripting allows windows to pop up, image resizing, and much, much more.</p>

<p>So, a web page contains HTML, CSS, and Javascript elements. Is that it? Nope, not by a longshot. There are many other conventions and additions to webpages, such as Flash animation, Java applets, video, sound, meta-data, and much, much more. This page only scratches the surface of Web Design :)!!</p>

<p>The best way to learn Web Page Design, as I've found out, is through a Website Designer that knows his trade. I was able to get this page done with the help of my friend, "W3bbo." Afterwards, I suggest people to review online sources and tutorials on Web Design as a review and second hand source. Only then can you properly design webpages :) !!</p>

<h2>About the T4 Office of Library Technology (OLT) Information Technology Internship</h2>


<p>The <acronym title="Today's Teens, Tomorrow's Techies">T4</acronym> Volunteer program of the Brooklyn Public Library decided to give their volunteers an opportunity that's never been given out before: an internship with the library's IT department, the Office of Library Technology. During the week of February 16th to the 22nd, the T4 program selected a group of lucky volunteers to experience the world of Information Technology in real life.
<img src="t4logo.JPG" alt="T4: Today's Teen Tomorrow's Techies" title="Today's Teen Tomorrow's Techies" id="t4bplLogo" /></p>

<p>I was one of those lucky few, and that week is a week I hold dear. During that week, I saw and experienced how IT was vital to the Brooklyn Public Library system, and I met many people that are responsible for keeping the library running behind the scenes. It was truly an amazing site. I learned much from the internship, and I met amazing people. After the internship ended, and seeing an IT department at work, I realized that I will continue pursuing a career that involves technology and computers; it is something that I love, to be around technology and people who, just like me, enjoy tech themselves.</p>

<h2>About this Web Page</h2>

<p>This page was originally a collaborated task by Enoch and I (Stanley) during the last day of the OLT internship. Unfortunately, we were unable to finish the page, and it was left alone for quite some time.</p>

<p>It wasn't until Susan (from OLT's Web Applications department) e-mailed me and expressed her wish for me and Enoch to finish the page so she can publish it. Susan and I both realized that the page had many errors and I noticed that the code was sloppy. Being that I had no communication with Enoch for the summer, I had to continue the web page on my own (so there might be two different finalised versions).</p>

<p>My friend, W3bbo, who's an experienced Web Designer, helped me out with my page, and after looking at the code for the first time, he said: OH GOD MY EYES. He advised me to start over, and wished to give me a more formal and modern approach to HTML/ Website design.</p>

<p>First thing that needed to be attended to was the content, and basic formating for it. Header tags, paragraph tags, and all that. Second, we needed the DTD, or Document Type Definition, tags on the top of the HTML code. This tag basically identifies to the world (or browsers) which version of (X)HTML your page is based on. Nexy, we went over CSS to fancy up and make my page look more presentable and eye pleasing. Before the CSS codes, the page simply looked like a very plain Word document, which isn't that much appealing. Using CSS, we were able to manipulate images, backgrounds, and fonts. Finally, we went over basic Javascripting for some special effects, minimizing and maximizing images of the page's progress!!</p>

<p>And now this is how the page turned out :) !! I really thank W3bbo for all his time and effort working with me. He spent hours of his time teaching me, discussing with me, and explaining to me the conventions of skillful web design. Thanks very much again !!</p>
