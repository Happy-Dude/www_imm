				<p><em>Review date:</em> 28 Jan 2011</p>
				
				
				<p>Another book written by Mike Meyers as part of the All-in-One series by McGraw, the Network+ Exam Guide seeks to provide readers with <strong>the</strong> goto guide for the CompTIA Network+ exam. If you have read my review for his A+ All-in-One guide, you know I respect Meyers&apos; knowledge and writing. This book follows the same general layout, with each chapter consisting of a historical overview/ background of the topic and then moving to more applied and practical knowledge needed for the exam. Each chapter closes with review questions to gauge how well you&apos;ve understood the material. Not too much difference, eh?</p>
				
				<p>Unfortunately, I&apos;m surprised that for a 4th edition book, the quality of review and editing for the book is disappointing. When I mean the quality of review is something like: &quot;What the <em>hell</em> were the editors thinking when they looked over this?!?&quot; There are too much errata in the sections which are probably the most important and also confusing to the reader. Whereas diagrams visually represent what the writing is trying to convey to the reader, even that is lost when the diagrams themselves are incorrect. I became extremely frustrated while trying to understand routing protocols and NAT, needing to glance over the material several times. I had to practically cross out the IP addresses from the diagrams and fix it myself, something I shouldn&apos;t need to do for a $60 book all-in-one reference guide, especially when the diagrams are supposed to complement the writing, not obfuscate it more.</p>
				
				<p>However, for what it is worth, if the reader is able to look past the (many) errors of the book, you still end up learning quite a lot. At 700+ pages (half of Meyers&apos; A+ guide, and still at the same price&#0133;), I was able to read the book cover to cover and I was able to pass the exam. If the reader has enough critical thinking skills and overall understanding of what he is reading, he should be perfectly capable of fixing those errors and press forward. Additionally, though it really shouldn&apos;t have been necessary, the reader can look up and match information from other sources to check the correctness of the material.</p>
				
				<p>For the same price as Meyers&apos; A+ guide, I did not feel that I got my $60  worth of quality material. While I did learn from the guide, I also had to make sure that what I was reading was correct. I have to a admit, having a heavy technology background helped me decipher the errors from the material. When it was book was correct, it was good quality study-guide material and a strong reference, but it is when it&apos;s wrong that everything can take a turn for the worst. A person with a weaker technical background won&apos;t be able to gauge the value or truth of the reading. I fear that the normal reader will go off taking the exam with heavy confidence due to what the book says and come out disappointed and short of $200. For that reason alone, I do not recommend this guide as the single source of study. Remember to keep a heavy watch on the book&apos;s <a href="http://www.totalsem.com/support/errata/index.php?book=mmng_MTN2">errata</a> on Meyers&apos; <a href="http://www.totalsem.com/index.php">website</a>. While I&apos;d like to recommend the book as a reference guide, even that is hard to do given the quantity of errors&#0133;</p>
