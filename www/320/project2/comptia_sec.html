				<p><em>Review date:</em> 28 Jan 2011</p>
				
				<p>My last review of the McGraw Hill&apos;s CompTIA guides isn&apos;t written by Mike Meyers, but rather by a variety of security professionals. The CompTIA Security+ exam happened to be my weakest subject with which I knew virtually nothing about, but surprisingly, I earned the highest score of the exams I took.</p>
				
				<p>Right off the bat, the book it is $60 and nearly as large as the Network+ guide. But let me tell you, this book is much more comprehensive. It is not heavy on diagrams (unless when necessary), but rather it is heavy on concepts and thoroughness. The quality of the material is great, but amidst the studying and reading, the reader may lose themselves in the heavy bodies of text and the erratic pacing.</p>
				
				<p>The chapters regularly overlap and review material from previous chapters, but usually at an unnecessary depth. I understand that they are trying to drill it into the reader, but after the fourth or fifth time, the writers overdid it a bit. However, the review questions following the chapters are great, and serve as one of the strongest aides in telling me what I had to look over more.</p>
				
				<p>The material the book covers is generally conceptual and contains very little practical information, such as system setup or use of a program. A strong emphasis is put on policies and management, which I felt was fine. But the two chapters focused on law&ndash;while informative&ndash;did not serve much help for me during the actual exam. The body of text around the cryptography section might become hard to get through, but that is perhaps the zenith of the book&ndash;the best section and most comprehensive. After cryptography, the book becomes much easier to get through afterwards. Also be aware that the sections afterwards will contain heavy bits of redundancy that could have been scaled back.</p>
				
				<p>Like the other two all-in-one guides, the book isn&apos;t without it&apos;s errors. Thankfully, it is nowhere close to the diagram-mishaps of the Network+ guide and more similar to the tiny grammar/ structural/ spelling errors of the A+ guide.</p>
				
				<p>As a reference, I am not sure how well this book would stand up. It is heavy on the concepts, and quick and brief on computer-specific details (thankfully). I wouldn&apos;t say the book was necessarily for depth, but for guidance and overview, it serves it&apos;s purpose. There are comprehensive guidelines and best-practices the text suggests, and are wonderful for implementing policies and recommendations. However, for the technical information, such as using and implementing protcols and programs, there is practically no information and the reference for those falls a bit short.</p>
				
				<p>Overall, the Security+ All-in-One guide is comprehensive, but also very flawed. It isn&apos;t an easy text to read for studying, and it isn&apos;t an in-depth reference either. Rather, I would describe it as <em>just enough</em> for the Security+ exam. Using the book in tandem with cram sheets and other materials/ references will get those planning to take the exam into where they want to be. Certainly better and clearer than the Network+ guide, but nowhere as thorough as the A+ guide, the Security+ guide falls somewhere in between.</p>
