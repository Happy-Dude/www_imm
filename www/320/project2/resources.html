			<ul>
				<li>The design of the website was done with the aid of one of my dormmates. The color scheme was provided (or inspired) by using <a href="http://colorschemedesigner.com/">Color Scheme Designer</a> the (with FF8E00 as the primary color). The stylesheet can be viewed <a href="./styles.css">here.</a></li>
				<li> Slashdot has a format of reviewing technical <a href="http://books.slashdot.org/books/08/02/20/1439224.shtml">books</a> that I sought to emulate somehow in my website.</li>
				<li> Of course, looking at Amazon as a reference on how they did their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Art-Exploitation-Jon-Erickson/product-reviews/1593271441/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8">user reviews</a> was unavoidable. I tried to get some inspiration, but I don't believe I would have the resources to implement some of the styling they did. However, what was more important to me was how they organized the information (such as ISBN and publication date) for their products.</li>
				<li>Images were (or at least, will be) gathered from Amazon and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=0FW3DMNhl1EC">Google Books</a></li>
