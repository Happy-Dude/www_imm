			<h1>Who Am I?</h1>
			<p> My name is Stanley Chan. I am a your typical geek enthusiast.</p>
			<p> Raised in New York City, I am currently attending the Rochester Institute of Technology and majoring in Information Security and Forensics. While computers are my main obsession, I also enjoy reading, playing video games, watching movies and television, and hanging out with my friends. I love discovering new and brilliant indie games as well as losing myself in the next science fiction, fantasy, or mystery novel that lands in my hands.</p> 
			<p>Being a tech hobbyist, I have come across many computer books. My room is filled with delivery boxes and the shelves packed with various tech-related books. Many of them I enjoyed and found worthwhile, and a very large handful a waste of my time. Time is money, and it's not like I could regain the hours I lost reading the book back. It's an experience that pushed me to make this website, a website of technology/ computer-related book reviews. You don't need to kill time, I will kill my own time for your sake!...</p>
