		<p>I have many interests. Though, they generally lie within the categories of leisure, self-fulfillment, and academics. Luckily for me, my academics are corresponding more and more with my self-fulfillment ambitions. I'm very happy that I am studying what I love and that I might very well be pursuing a career that I can truly dedicate myself to.</p>
		
		<p>With regards to academics, I am currently double majoring in <em>Information Security and Forensics</em> and <em>Applied Networking and Systems Administration</em>. InfoSec was my primary major coming into the Rochester Institute of Technology, and I choose that because it was a strong interest of mine. Networking and Administration, on the other hand, is one of my comfort zones. I have a fair amount of knowledge and experience regarding those topics, and I felt that I can further expand them at the university. Combined with information security, I think I can learn a lot about stuff that I truly enjoy and become very well rounded in a variety of computing-related subjects.</p>
		
		<p>I consider anything I enjoy that is not work to be part of my leisurely activities. I love reading fiction, particularly science fiction, mystery, horror, and adventure. Additionally, I quite enjoy reading about current events (during the little time I actually do spend doing it). However, most of the time, I am more up-to-date in current events regarding technology and computing. Also, I enjoy several television generes. The shows I like have strong character and plot development (such as <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>). Finally, I enjoy good movies just like any other guy on the block. Surprisingly, I find myself enjoying romance movies... But hey, I find some that are quite fun and effective emotionally-wise.</p>
		
		<p>Finally, I kind of enjoy the silly stuff. Idling around (because everyone needs some time alone somewhere along the line), creeping friends out and making things slightly awkward for them, and sleeping at random times of the day just becaues I can. It's all in good fun, and it makes up part of my personality.</p>
